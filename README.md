# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of conducting this analysis is to allow users to apply weather criteria (in this case, destinations between 70-90 degrees Fahrenheit) to find potential travel destinations that fit their needs. Using Google API's, we mapped the cities, performed route analysis, and identified hotels in each town. In this analysis, we identified 4 cities in Europe we'd like to travel to - 1 in Portugal and 3 in Spain. 

## Summary of Analysis
Please see our code and analysis in each folder:

For this vacation, we'll be starting off in southern Portugal and making our way to northern Spain then onto two cities in southern Spain. Of the 2,000 random cities we queries, this trip made sense because the average temperature is between 70-90 degrees in each city and the travel distances are manageable.

We generated 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes then narrowed down our search to cities with temperatures between 70-90 degrees. From there we used Google Maps API's to trace routes and find hotels on the Google Map interface (necessary screenshots are included).
